Dharshaanan holds a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from Swansea University, United Kingdom. His thesis's main objective is to critically evaluate the nano-scale interfacial processes in tribological systems such as wear, friction, and lubrication within gas turbine engines. The experimental methodologies developed will be combined with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate e.g., cobalt and nickel–based systems under extreme conditions. The atomistic insights gained will help to develop next generation aerospace materials capable of working effectively in harsh environments. This research will help overcome many of the aerospace challenges ranging from improving durability of the aircraft and premature failure of the components to developing novel gas turbine engines. In addition to my academic adventures, I enjoy most of my recreational time outdoors embracing nature with activities such as hiking in the summer and snowboarding in the winter. My leisure pursuit includes reading and being an excellent professional choreographer/dancer.",
