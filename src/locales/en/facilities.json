        "description": "Thermal spraying is a coating process that uses a heat source to melt a material and propel it onto a substrate. The material is melted in the form of a powder, wire, or rod, and is then sprayed onto the substrate using a high-velocity gas stream. The material solidifies on the substrate to form a coating.
